Annotation Project
There are 9 regions from the wheat genome (triticum aestivum ) to annotate.

The annotation project is to be submitted by groups of 2 or 3:

think about the potential difficulties of annotating wheat before you start predicting genes (hexaploid genome, homeologous genes, 80% of transposable elements)

you must completely annotate the given sequence:

- genes: complete coordinates of intron-exon structure and UTR, , validation by the presence of transcribed sequences and/or homologous genes.

- proteins : potential protein functions, motifs and domaines

- transposable elements: coordinates and family of the transposable element.

The report must be written in laboratory notebook format. It must be made in such a way that I can repeat the analysis you have carried out with all parameters for each tool.

Send me a table with the names in each groups and the sequence to be annotated.

deadline : end of december, submission on ecampus
